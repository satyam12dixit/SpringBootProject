Ans1)-Wrapper class means it will used to convert primitive data type to Class Type  (int( wrapper class-INTEGER),long(wrapper-class LONG),flot(wrapper class-FLOAT) double( w.c-DOUBLE))
it is avoid typecasting(Widing) of data Type.

Ans2). StringBuffer is Syncronized and mutable.if you want to perform any operation on same objects
      then it will perform.if i have required fluent change in Application then we should Use StringBuffer concepts.

         public class StringBufferDemo{
       
          public static void main(String[] args){
           
          StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer();
          System.out.println(sb.capacity());//16
             sb.append("abcdefg");
          System.out.println(sb);


   --->String Builder is not a Thread-Safe multuple Thread Operate at a time in single Objects its means Performance wise  Very Good
       Present Inside StringBuilder All Method is Non-Syncronized Method.
           
Ans3)-->List-> if You want to Represent a group of Individuals Objects in Single Entity where Duplicate is allowed and Insertion Order Must be Preserved Then we Should
                      go for List Interface.
          --->Duplication Allowed.
          --->Homogenous Allowed and Hetrogenous Element Allowed.
          --->Insertion Order Must Be Preserved.
                        
                     List l=new ArrayList();
                       l.add("aaa");
                       l.add("BBB");
                       l.add("aaa");
                System.out.println(l);//aaa,BBB,aaa

  Set-->If we Want to represent a Group Of Individual Objets in Single Entity Where Insertion Order Must not be Preserved and Duplicat Values are Not Allowed then we
         should go for Set Interface.
     -->Duplicate Not Allowed.
     -->Insertion Order Must Not be Preserved.
     -->We Can Add Hetrogenous  and Homogenous Element.

            Set s= new HashSet();
               s.add("satyam");
               s.add("Anil");//Insertion Oreder Must Not Preserved
               s.add("10");//Ant type element
               s.add("satyam");//duplicate not allowed error
               System.out.println(s);

Ans4)-.   The Exception which are checked by Compiler wheather programmer handling or not,for smooth execuation of the programme at
              runtime,are Called Checked Exception.
Example-->
              sqlException
               IoException
              FileNotFoundExcepion


           Unchecked Exception--->
           The exception which are not checked by compile time wheather Programmer Handle Or not that exception are called checked Exception.

Example-->
          AirthmaticException,
          ArrayIndexOutOfException
          NullPointerException.
              
Ans5)  Statement-> we have used statement when Sql Query Excuted Only Once Then we sholud go for Statement.
               -->Statement is very slow in performance Wise

      Prepare Statement-> suppose we want to execute Query in Multiple time then we Should go for Prepare Statement.
     Prepare Statement Is very Good In Performance Wise.


Ans6)--We have to Use Generic concepts for provide TypeSafty and Avoiding- type Casting Problem Every Time in Collection.Then we Should Go for Generic Concepts
   
       List<Integer> l= new ArrayList<>();
   //here we can add only integer type values
               l.add(10);
                l.add(20);
               l.add(10);
          System.out.println(l);// Here We Have Provide Type Safty by using Genric Concepts.

Ans7)-->
      java-7
    try-with resource
    String in switch Statements
     state management
Java 1.8 All Features 

  Functional Interface-> if an Interface can conatain only one abstract method and n number of default and static method then it is called Function Interface.
   ex->Comparater,Runner,Supplier,Predicate,Consumer etc.

2)  Lambda Expression--> is used to provide the implemention of functional Interface .it is used to reduces bunch of annonymouse class and less memory.

3)  Default Method()->this method comes in java8 version by using this method we can add utility requirement for our implementation class if i want otherwise it will 
     not force to override this method to implement in implemation class.
 
    public interface greet{
   
    public void abstract eat();

     default sleepAfternoon(){
   }
}

4)  static Method-> we have to declear static method in java8 for access without object creation in java .by using interface name we can access static method in jhava.
 
5)  Method Reference--> we can use to refer the method to the Lqmbda expression by using :: operator that is called Method Reference.

6) Stream Api--> it is used to process the collection data.its provided multiple methods to use to process the bunch of collection Data.


Ans8)---Model View And Controller--->
  Model is nothing but Data is called Model.it is Used to read the Data From the View Component to The Controler That is Called Model.

  View-> it Is Nithing But Present Layer Component We have to Send the Data From View Componet.
    ex:_Index.html is View Compoment.

  Controller-> Controller Is a Java Class We can Call it is A Web Component We can Send Process The Bushiness Logic In View Component and Return to The Dispatcher Servlet
    ModelAnd View.

Execution Flow of Spring MVC?

1)--> End User Make A request.
2)--> request  send to the Dispatcher Servlet Nothing But Front Controller.
3)-->then Front Controller send Request to the Handler Mapper and Handler Mapper Identiyfy the Request and search Appropiate Controllerr and Appropiate Method.
4)-->again Handler Mapper Send The Controller And Method Information to the Dispatcher servlet then Dispatcher Servlet go to The Apptropiate Controller and method.
5)-->Controller Identify the request and send request to the appropiate Method to perform the Bushiness Logic and it will Perform Bushiness Logic and Return ModelAndView Component.
6)-->then Controller return return MODELANDVIEW to again Dispatcher Servlet.but view component without Extension it will return.
7)->then Dispatcher Servlet go threw to View Resolver and view Resolver search the prefix and suffix of view Component and it will return to the Dispatcher Servlet
8)--> Dispatcher Servlet Then go to the View Component and Render the Data from Model Attiribte and it will send to The Again Dispatcher Servlet.
9)-->Dispatcher servlet send Data to The Front Controller by using http://localhost:8080/user hyperlink.


Ans9)--Qualifier In Spring
      Some time we have two same type of Dependent classes then Ioc container will got Ambiguity Error  because this can not Identify the Dependent Class to
         then we have to use Qualifier Annotation in Spring.
     ex: @Qualifier ,@Primary.

Ans10)-->IOC Container Is a Inversion Of Control is not not Provided by Sring Framework .it is Responsible for Manage Dependency Between Two Component and
        manage the life cycle of Object Creation to Destruction in Spring Framework.

       FileSystemResource
        ClassPathResource

Ans11)-->Spring is a powerful non-invassive lossely couple, lightweight framework we have to used for application development.you can say that the Spring framework is a well-defined
          tool that supports several web applications using Java as a programming language.

Ans12)-->No We Can not Use Jsp As A Controller because Jsp is a Server Side Component. we have to use for Present Layer Component.

Ans13)-->Spring Standlone Application Scope is Singleton in Case Of Spring Standlone Projects.

Ans14)->In Html5 Intoduces Some new Tags
      <Aside>--> We have to use a piece of content that is only realted to the rest Of Page.
     
    <audio>  we have represent Audio file.
    <datalist> We can use this tag to make combo box for input attribute
    <meter>  manage a measurement such like as Diks usages.

     <wbr> we can use for line break.
     <Video> we Can create A Video File.

Ans15) Jsp if You have Write Jsp tag then you must write code of all implementation and logic of those tag in java.
       But In Jstl it is just a Laibrary Provided by Sun to apply such functionality in server page.
Ans16)  css selector - <p>,id,class selecto(.center)

Ans17) Fuction is used to calculate Bushiness Logic from given function.
  procuder-> it is used to given collection of Command to set the order of execution.

Ans18) tate management database mainly used in large scale applications for making the architecure and quality of code better.It is used as for optimizing better performance and storage device as well.
It is an alternative to cache state data in memory for reducing the amount of runtime memory

Ans19)->.ID and class selector used in CSS and the main difference is class selector defined as fullstop(.) and Id selector defined as hash(#).class is used to specify more than one element and Id specify one particular element only.  

Ans20)- Trigger is a stored procedure in Database Which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the Databse occurs.
